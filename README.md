Featured Work: PhD project "Collaborative conversational agent for science education" ([presented at ISLS23](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D_vEvAn6I7nYSniavMn7zcz27goYEEkT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117296470013615203144&rtpof=true&sd=true)). 

I am currently developing Clair (Collaborative learning agent for interactive reasoning), and currently evaluating Clair with dozens of secondary students in Brazil and the Netherlands.

Clair's prototype is running on [Go-Lab](https://www.golabz.eu/) and [graasp.eu](https://graasp.eu/); contact me if you wish to know more or interact with it.
