Featured Work: Designing a collaborative conversational agent for science education. 

I am currently developing Clair (Collaborative learning agent for interactive reasoning). 

More precisely, I am currently experimenting Clair with dozens of students in Brazil and the Netherlands.

Clair's prototype is running on [Go-Lab](https://www.golabz.eu/) and [graasp.eu](https://graasp.eu/); contact me if you wish to test or interact with it.
