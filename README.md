Featured Work: [Designing a collaborative conversational agent for science education](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LnINQ8ErZn4EkYuBrSE79vObzBoe9lrWxebTceHI6yY/edit?usp=sharing). 

I am currently developing Clair (Collaborative learning agent for interactive reasoning).  

More precisely, I am currently experimenting Clair with dozens of students in Brazil and the Netherlands.

Clair's prototype is running on [Go-Lab](https://www.golabz.eu/) and [graasp.eu](https://graasp.eu/); contact me if you wish to test or interact with it.
